Anagram Maker:

This program will output a list of anagrams given a String.
It will take words from either a dictionary txt file supplied via command line arguments, or the one used by default, which is very large.
First the program will ask the user for the number of lines to process. Then the user will enter one line at a time, with the program finding all possible anagrams for each line.
